# Syntax (unfinished)



note: every statement must end with a period


## Enviroment Variables
```
advanced-mode = true. //sets advanced syntax to true. Includes Linux command support
graphics-mode = true. //sets the graphics_EngineOn internal variable to true

cSyntax = true. //enables C-like syntax for Zoom

```
## Output:
```
print = "hello".
// or 
printline = "hello".
```

## Declaring Variables
```
string sample = "hello".
bool x = true.
integer y = 5.
double z = 2.4.
```

## Classes And Objects
```
class hello;
// Stuff
end class.

hello = new hello.

class hello:hewwo;
//Class inheritance
end class.
```


## Methods
```
static  new();
// Stuff
end static method.
static string  new([Args]);
//Stuff
end string method.
```

## Decisions & Accepting user input
```
Userinput().
// example:
string hewwo = Userinput().
```
## Math
```
a = 2 + 2.
math.sqrt(5).

a = pow(4(3)).

a = avrg({dataset}).

a = factorial(5).

a = sin(5).

a = log(5, base=2.71828182845905).

a = MAD({dataset}{dataset}).

a = percent(5.1).

a = Decimal(5).

a = 
```
## Data Structures
```
// array 
array = new array[].
array[0] = "hi".
end array.

//dictionary

hey = new Dictionary([5]).
add[0] "hey".
end Dictionary.

//list 
list = new list.
add to list "wut".
end list.

//dataset WARNING: ONLY USE FOR NUMBERS
average = new dataset[].
add 5 to average.
end dataset.
```
wow
